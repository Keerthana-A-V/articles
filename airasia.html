                    <p>Air Asia was established in 1993 and commenced its operations on 18th November 1996. This airline
                        was
                        originally founded by a government owned conglomerate DRB-Hicom. However, on 2nd December 2001,
                        the
                        heaviliy indebted airline was purchased by former Time Warner executive Tony Fernandes’s company
                        Tune Air Sdn Bhd for the token sum of one ringgit. Fernandes proceeded to engineer a remarkable
                        turnaround, turning a profit in 2002 and launching new routes from its hub in KLIA at breakneck
                        speed which undercutting former monopoly operator Malaysia Airlines with promotional fares as

                        national airline. Also, it was the first successful low cost and ticket-less airline in the
                        Southeast Asian region. It is main based in the Low Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) at Kuala Lumpur
                        International Airport (KLIA). And, AirAsia has a registered office in Petaling Jaya, Selangor
                        and
                        its head office is on the grounds of KLIA in Sepang, Selangor. In addition, AirAsia is one of
                        the
                        successful businesses that have adopted cost leadership thoroughly through effectiveness and
                        efficiency of the operation management. AirAsia has broken the travel norms around the world

                        Xiamen, Shenzen) and India.

                        The airline will focus on developing its hubs in Bangkok and Jakarta through its sister
                        companies,
                        Thai AirAsia and Indonesia AirAsia. Hence, with increase frequency and addition of new routes,
                        AirAsia expects passenger volume to hit 18 million by end-2007. On 27 March 2006, the Government
                        of
                        Malaysia announced that AirAsia will take over 96 non-trunk routes, in addition to 19 domestic
                        trunk
                        routes. This was part of Malaysia Airlines route rationalization programme which saw a large
                        number
                        of its domestic sectors being transferred to AirAsia from 1 August 2006.

                        On September 27, 2008, AirAsia has on its list 106 new routes to be added to its current list of
                        60
                        over the next few years. Technology AirAsia widely utilises the Internet as a booking and
                        payment
                        channel. Its website at www. airasia. com allows guests to book and pay for seats, check flight
                        schedules, and acquire information about the airline. About 45% of AirAsia’s business is done
                        through Internet sales. It also became the first airline in the world to offer a multilingual
                        website that comes in six languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Mandarin, Tamil, Thai and Bahasa
                        Indonesia.</p>

                    <p>AirAsia is one of the first foreign airline to set up a subordinate airline industry in India.
                        The
                        company marked the Tata Group's return to the aviation industry.


                         AirAsia India is a joint venture (JV) between the Tata group and Malaysia-based AirAsia Berhad
                        AirAsia group. Where the Tatas own 51% stake and the remaining 49% is with AirAsia Bhd. The
                        Malaysian airline group, which has been reporting losses, reportedly approached the Tatas in
                        June to
                        sell its part of the stake. The offer was refused by Tata Sons.


                        Even the AirAsia India is floundering to achieve a reversal of policy, having gained profits
                        only
                        for a single quarter since it began operations six years ago. Tata Sons, the other JV partner
                        with a
                        51 per cent stake, has so far made no money out of it. 


                        There are also suppositions that Tata is planning to consolidate its exiting stake in AirAsia
                        with
                        Air India into a single enterprise. It is also important to mention that the national carrier
                        started as a division of Tata Sons Ltd in 1932 and was run as 'Tata Airlines' till 1946, after
                        which
                        it became a public limited company, renamed as Air India due to nationalization.


                        From Tata Airlines and Air India to Vistara and AirAsia India, the Tata group has always been an
                        important part of the growing aviation sector in India.</p>

                    <p>Flying Beast Gaurav Taneja who got suspended from job as a pilot, after he raised his voice
                        publically on some flight safety issues in AirAsia Airlines. AirAsia India is under governor
                        probe
                        for reportedly violation of safety practices. The move comes to light a day after aviation
                        regulator
                        The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). It is the statutory body formed under the
                        Aircraft
                        (Amendment) Bill, 2020. DGCA sent a show-cause notice to AirAsia India's Head of Operations,
                        Manish
                        Uppal. 

                        Mr Taneja in his YouTube video has explained the safety issues of AirAsia India. Taneja also
                        tweeted
                        "So good to see that #AirAsia has not yet come up with a statement “WE ARE NOT UNSAFE”.


                        The violations are related to safety protocols, ignorance of The Directorate General of Civil
                        Aviation circulars on covid-19 safety of passengers, ignorance of sick leaves of pilots and
                        pressurising pilots to use flap 3 landings in a way to save fuel 98% of time.

                        Taking knowledge of that, the DGCA had Tweeted on June 15 “DGCA has taken note of the concerns
                        raised by some stakeholders against a particular airline and its approach to safety. DGCA has
                        already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based
                        on
                        the outcome of the said investigation.”</p>

                    <p>In June this year, one of AirAsia India’s former pilot who runs a YouTube channel called Flying
                        Beast. Gaurav Taneja, who has, first raised safety issues at AirAsia through a tweet on June 13,
                        though he didn’t disclose any details. Gaurav Taneja was terminated by the airline on Friday.
                        Taneja
                        tweeted the same around midnight on Monday he tweeted “I was terminated from AirAsia for raising
                        safety issues! Now, the same issues are raised by DGCA to Air Asia India. Justice will
                        prevail!”.
                        This comes a fortnight after he was suspended from the airline.



                        Soon after Taneja’s termination, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on Sunday,
                        issued
                        a showcause notice to a senior executive of AirAsia India over Taneja’s allegations of violation
                        of
                        safety norms. A DGCA official said that the showcause notice has been served after the pilot's
                        allegations. "AirAsia India confirms receipt of the notice and we are assisting the regulator in
                        its
                        fact-finding process. We will fully cooperate with the regulator," said an AirAsia India
                        spokesperson.

                        In his video on June 14, however, he made several allegations with respect to the violation of
                        safety norms by the airline. He alleged that he was made to work on his off days and said that
                        putting sick pilots in the cockpit is risky. When he escalated this to the chief of the safety
                        of
                        the airline, he allegedly wrote back that he undergo lifestyle counselling and medical tests
                        again.

                        He also alleged that protocols, that were in place in March when coronavirus was spreading, were
                        not
                        followed properly by the airline (although he does not outline which), and stated that from
                        March 24
                        onwards, he refused to fly.

                        He also alleged that the airline asks its pilots to do 98% of landings in "Flap 3" mode, which
                        allows it to save fuel. Failing to do this is considered a violation by the airline, he alleged.
                        Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create a drag during a landing or
                        a
                        take-off.

                        After this, Amit Singh, the former Chief of Safety at AirAsia India, also tweeted that he
                        resigned
                        with just a day’s notice and refused to work with the company because the company allegedly
                        asked
                        him to hide safety issues. “As the Chief of Flight Safety of AirAsia India after launch, I
                        resigned
                        and left with 1 days’ notice. I refused to work for them for a minute after they asked me to
                        hide
                        safety related issues. Such is the safety culture there. They accused me of working for
                        @DGCAIndia
                        instead of them,” he tweeted.

                        Soon after this DGCA took note of the concerns raised and began investigating the airline.</p>

                    <p>Air Asia has been on a drift from years, due to different reasons as company going in loss and so
                        on.
                        These time are already tough due to the prevailing pandemic. Various services are suffering a
                        huge
                        loss and so is Air Asia.


                        Recently the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) suspended Captain Manish Uppal, the
                        Head
                        of Operations, Air Asia and Captain Mukesh Neema, Chief of Flight Safety, Air Asia, on safety
                        violations by Air Asia. Taneja's allegations regarding the safety as the company sent sick pilot
                        on
                        work and instructed pilots to do "flap 3" in order to save fuel.  Registered allegations says
                        that
                        the low-cost carrier violates safety norms and puts the lives of its pilots, crew and all the
                        passengers at risk.


                        In June, the DGCA took note of the complaints raised by a number of stakeholders and started an
                        investigation into the reported issues. The aviation regulator said it will "take appropriate
                        action
                        based on the outcome of the said investigation".


                        However, the aviation watchdog has received criticism for announcing a short-term suspension of
                        the
                        carrier's top brass as compared to the suspension of the pilot.
                        Also, DGCA mentioned that AirAsia India was under investigation after Taneja's allegations.</p>

                    <p>The youtuber who raised his voice against the safety issues of passengers in Air Asia Mr. Gaurav
                        Taneja also a pilot by profession alleged in his youtube video that, "the AirAsia airline by
                        which
                        we travel is unsafe." Initially he said when we ask for sick leave it is counted as off day.
                        "Pilots
                        do fear asking for a sick leave, as it may lead to punitive action," The punitive action may be
                        in
                        the form of a lower bonus.
                        "On any other job, one could go to work despite feeling a bit under the weather. As a pilot, I
                        can't
                        afford to do that," says the pilot. 

                        Secondly, he talked about standard operating procedure (SOPs) not being followed. Though he
                        doesn't
                        get into the details on which SoPs were not being followed.

                        Lastely he talked about landing issues. Flap 3 or Flap 4.
                        The purpose of the flaps is to generate more lift at slower airspeed, which enables the airplane
                        to
                        fly at a greatly reduced speed with a lower risk of stalling. This is especially useful during
                        takeoff and landing.
                        A no-flaps landing is done in the conditions of strong or gusty winds. 
                        Flap 3 is more preferred as it saves fuel which is the reason why nearly all airlines advise
                        their
                        pilots to use this mode of landing, rather than Flap 4.

                        But the AirAsia airline has asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in "Flap 3" mode,
                        which
                        allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98 per cent of landings in "Flap 3" mode,
                        the
                        airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure or also denoted as SOP.</p>

                        Safety
                        are suspended for three months over violations of safety protocols. 



                        The DGCA had issued a show-cause notice to Air Asia India on June 28, in connection with a pilot
                        levelling allegation that the airline engaged in compromising safety protocols. 


                        The AirAsia came into the soptlight during the month of June, when a suspended AirAsia Pilot,
                        Gaurav
                        Taneja levelled allegations against Air Asia company through his YouTube channel called "Flying

                        carrier,
                        forcing the pilots to use a landing mechanism that would save fuel. He allegedly said that they
                        are
                        not at all worried for the safety of their passengers rather forcing to save fuel as much as
                        possible. He tweeted, on June 14, that he has been suspended by AirAsia India "for standing up
                        for
                        safety operations of an aircraft and its passengers". The following day, he posted a detailed
                        video
                        on YouTube entitled "Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job".


                        On the suspension of the two executives, Taneja tweeted, "Capt Manish Uppal and Mukesh Neema

                        the Pilots to use a landing mechanism that would save fuel. He added how the pilots were being
                        mentally tortured by the company for the above reason. 
                        Taneja was suspended as soon as this came into notice by the airline company. He then came up
                        with a
                        video and disclosed the reason of his suspension and company's malpractices with solid evidence.
                        His movement accumulated massive support from the netizens who also filed an RTI to seek
                        complete
                        information from the aviation company.


                        Taneja's stand for the right cause throughout gave him favourable results, Captain Manish Uppal
                        (Head Of Operations) and Captain Mukesh Nema (Chief Of Flight Safety) were suspended by DGCA.
                        After
                        this news, he decided to send a savage box of surprise to AirAsia - a box full or burnol tubes
                        and
                        tweeted,


                        "Sending a box full of this #SabKeLiye Please distribute properly. No cheating this time please
                        @AirAsiaIndian #BurnolForAirasia."</p>

                    <p>Air Asia has fired Captain Gaurav Taneja, who brought out the company's malpractices in order to
                        save
                        fuel and for that neglecting  the safety of the passengers. He is said to have acted as a
                        whistleblower as he exposed the unlawful activity which went on, in the Air Asia company. 


                        On June 14, Taneja came up with a YouTube video and said that he has been suspended by the
                        AirAsia
                        company for standing up for "safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers." Taneja alleged
                        that
                        the company forced the Pilots to use a landing technique called "Flap 3" mode in order to save
                        fuel.
                        Thus, for a minimal amout of fuel, the passengers safety is being compromised. 


                        On June 15, the aviation regulator DGCA tweeted that it has taken note of allegations against a
                        "particular airline". Consequently, the DGCA had decided to issue a showcause notice to a senior
                        executive of the airline after the alleged violation of safety norms came to light. The
                        showcause
                        notice has been served post the pilot's allegations.


                        Air Asia issued a statement that  it has complied with the direction of DGCA and appointed
                        INTERIM
                        POST HOLDERS  while maintaining that it prioritizes safety. Authorities will exercise an option
                        of
                        an appeal for addressal. 
                        "AirAsia India confirms receipt of the notice and we are assisting the regulator in its fact
                        finding
                        process. We will fully cooperate with the regulator," said an AirAsia India spokesperson.


                        While, On June 26, Taneja, who was already suspended got dismissed for publicly alleging safety
                        violations at the airline.</p>

                    <p>AirAsia is the first subordinate aviation industry in India. Ever since its launch, AirAsia India
                        has
                        been involved in one controversy or the other.


                        Now this is being speculated Tata is planning to merge its exiting stake in AirAsia with Air
                        India
                        into a single entity. After all the controversial draught of being in loss, not treating
                        employees
                        in a proper decorum and risking passengers life in order to save fuel have brought a negative
                        impact
                        on industries goodwill.


                        It can be said that this is going to be a tough task to regain customers trust and reputation.
                        For
                        this the company will have to stick to all the safety norms according to the aviation industry.
                        And
                        also taking all the precautionary measures during the pandemic. 


                        AirAsia will have to prioritise the safety of the passengers and the crews. Also, to create a
                        healthy working environment where the employees won't fear to ask for leave during emergency and
                        make sure that they are not finding the job as a burden.</p>
