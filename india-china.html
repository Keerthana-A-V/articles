                <p>Diplomatic relations between
                    India and China.
                    India is the first non-socialist country to
                    establish diplomatic relations with China,
                    the communist government. The joint
                    enunciation of Panchsheel - the 5
                    principles of peaceful co- existence by the
                    Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese
                    Premier Zhou Enlai was a step towards a
                    stronger relationship. Annexation of Tibet by Chinese caused
                    huge conflicts between the two countries
                    and the tension was also heated due to
                    border disputes caused by China. It took
                    more than a decade to normalize the
                    situation. Trade was the only positive
                    relation between both the countries. They had signed agreements on cultural
                    exchanges and co-operation in science. Bilateral trade between India and China
                    has increased from $338 million in 1992 to
                    more than $84 billion in 2017,
                    But we need to relook how the relation
                    would continue after the post- covid
                    world. The solidarity between the two
                    countries may be degraded due to lack of
                    transparency and trust issues of China. The public perception of Indians has
                    become very negative and the whole
                    world has socially distanced themselves
                    from China. India has been doing the
                    same. The first step is by banning 59
                    Chinese apps. The outbreak of this
                    pandemic will sure change our relations
                    with China since it the one to be blamed
                    for.</p>

                <p>Indo-China Trade.
                    China being the largest exporter to India surely has its upper hand there and it would be a great 
                    troublesome situation for both the countries to have disputes amid this world wide pandemic due to 
                    the CORONA VIRUS.
                    It won’t be wrong to say that Indian MSME sector is very much dependent on various Chinese 
                    imports and that too when it has been in the middle of crisis since a couple of years.
                    Although for the business experts and other analysts it is going to be an interesting show that how 
                    both the countries and going to revive their respective manufacturing sector and the economy as a 
                    whole if thing go wrong.
                    Figuratively speaking, In 2019-20 China accounted over 5% of India’s total exports which includes a 
                    wide range of products including iron ore, cotton yarn, coconuts, copper. Whereas Imports from 
                    china accounted for more than 14 percent, mobile phones and its accessories holding the top spot 
                    over 48% of the total import.

                    The above figures shows that India runs a huge trade deficit with china which puts India on the
                    back 
                    foot to take major decisions, although Indian government has already taken some strong decisions 
                    to match up the sentiments of Indian citizens to boycott Chinese products. 
                    India already has its plans to counter Chinese huge imports, The MAKE IN INDIA programme which 
                    was launched in 2014 but Indian economy has not seen or gained much out of it.</p>

                <p>INDIA-CHINA DTAA


                    Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement(DTAA)is an accord for the avoidance of double taxation to a
                    citizenary of either or the both nation entalgled to the concord.


                    India-China bilateral significance to DTAA kicked off to a flier in july 1984.The recent development
                    in harmony with the concurrence was observed in Nov.2018.


                    The amendment in the prevailing protocols has now bound both the nation to sticl to the recent
                    international standards.


                    The DTAA is just not about Tax- Credit or Tax- Exemption but it also indirectly helps both the
                    nation to understand each other economic and  monetary policies and aid to prosper growth. However,
                    In  critical circumstances,the accord may be terminated from either party by notifying other.</p>

                <p>INDIA CHINA DOKLAM BORDER ISSUE- 
                    Docklam, or Donglang in Chinese, is an area spread over less than 100sq km comprising a platform and
                    a valley at the Tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China. It is surrounded by Chumbi
                    Valley of Tibet, Bhutan Ha Valley and Sikkim. In 2017, a dispute arose between Indian Armed Force
                    and the
                    People’s Liberation Army of China. In June, 2017, the Chinese troops started constructing road on
                    the disputed area of Doklam which the Chinese claims it to be a a part of its Donglang region.
                    However, India and Bhutan recognize it as Doklam, a Bhutan territory. Bhutan has a very strategic
                    position considering the geography of India. To foster the relationship, India and Bhutan had signed
                    a “Friendship Treaty” in 2007 which made India to intervene for the goodwill of Bhutan among other
                    provisions. Also, Bhutan had asked for India’s help to protect its interest in Doklam from Chinese
                    intervention. The question that arose was why Doklam region was so important to these nations. The
                    reason being was that the area of Doklam carries huge military advantages and if it falls into the
                    hands of China, the security of India and Bhutan will be at stake. The access to Tri-junction area
                    shall be easy for the transportation of war machinery to the border of India. In this case, if there
                    is a war between India and China, China will be able to conquer the Chicken’s neck of India which
                    connects the North-Eastern states to rest of India. So, Indian Army was sent in order to stop the
                    Chinese troops from constructing roads on the disputed area of Doklam. The military standoff
                    continued for more than two months. China
                    accused India for entering their border. Well after diplomatic conversations, both the troops were
                    withdrawn from the border. Talking about the consequences of this standoff, I do not think it was an
                    impactful one. The Chinese government claimed that it is
                    their sovereign right so the Chinese troops will be present at the border. They were ready to
                    maintain peace further. Till now, there have been no instances regarding any disturbances on that
                    border.</p>
