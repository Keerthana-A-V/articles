                    <p>Murshid Quli Khan was the first Nawab of Bengal. 
                        He was originally born a Hindu as Surya Narayan Mishra.
                        The city of Murshidabad was named after him.
                        He was Nawab of Bengal from 1717 to 1727.
                        Unlike other Islamic rulers, Murshid Quli Khan had only one wife, Nasiri Banu Begum, and no
                        concubines. He had three children, two daughters and one son</p>
                    <p>Murshid Quli Khan Character:
                        He took no delight in hunting; He never indulged in wine nor in any intoxicating drugs; neither
                        did
                        he amuse himself with singers or dancers. He always kept constant to one lawful wife, and, out
                        of
                        excess of delicacy, would not suffer any strange woman, or even eunuchs, to enter the apartments
                        of
                        his seraglio - so much so, that any slave girl once out of the harem would not be
                        allowed to re-enter it. He possessed very extensive learning, and paid great respect to men who
                        were
                        eminent for their piety
                        or erudition. He was a brave soldier, a liberal benefactor, upright and just in his dealings,
                        and a
                        steady protector of the weak.
                        He made no retrenchments in any royal grant, nor in those of any former Subahdar, for charitable
                        purposes.
                        He despised all the refinements of luxury, particularly in dress; no highly seasoned dishes were
                        served on his table.
                        He slept but little, and carefully observed the stated times for prayer. From breakfast till
                        noon he
                        employed himself in copying the Koran, and in administering justice; and every year he sent
                        Korans
                        of his own writing, with valuable offerings, to Mecca, Medina, Najaf, and other holy places.

                    <p>Bidhan Chandra Roy was the Chief Minister of Bengal from 1948 to 1962 until his death. Dr. Roy
                        was
                        awarded with Bharat Ratna on Feb4, 1961.

                        He was a renowned Indian doctor, an educationist, a philanthropist and a freedom fighter. He is
                        considered to be the founder of five very prominent cities of Bengal; Durgapur, Howrah,
                        Ashoknagar,
                        Kalyani and Bidhannagar.

                        National Doctor's Day in India is celebrated each year in his memory, as he was the only few
                        people
                        from history who obtained a degree in FRCS and MRCP.

                        Dr. Roy was born in a bengali family in Bankipore, Patna, with his father working as an Excise
                        Inspector and a very pious and social worker mother. 

                        The partition of Bengal was happening when Bidhan was still in his college, he was emotionally
                        touched by this but he controlled his emotions and chose to continue on his education, so he
                        could
                        serve the nation better this way.

                        One of the example of his strict determination is when he went to St. Bartholomev's Hospital,
                        England with only 1200rs and applied for his masters, he was kept being rejected by the Dean
                        because
                        he was an Asian. But Dr. Roy didn't stop by this, and after applying 30 times in a row, the Dean
                        had
                        to accept his application. After completing his Post Graduate, he became a member of Royal
                        College
                        of Physicians and a fellow of Royal College of Surgeons.

                        Dr. Roy then believed that Swaraj (the call for India's freedom)  would remain a dream if people
                        were unhealthy with their body and mind. He taught and contributed at many medical institutions
                        like
                        Calcutta Medical College, Campbell Medical School, Carmichael Medical College, Jadavpur TB
                        Hospital,
                        Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Kamla Nehru Memorial Hospital, Victoria Institution, and Chittaranjan
                        Cancer Hospital.

                        In 1942, when Rangoon fell to Japanese attack, it caused an exodus of people fearing Japanese
                        invasion, Dr. Roy was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. He there acquired
                        air-raid
                        shelters for schools and colleges to have their classes and also provided shelter and relief for
                        students, teachers and other employees. He was awarded Doctorate of Science in 1944 for his
                        noble
                        and dynamic contributions.

                        "My young friends, you are soldiers in the battle of freedom - freedom from want, fear,
                        ignorance,
                        frustration and helplessness. By a dint of hard work for the country, rendered in a spirit of
                        selfless service, may you march ahead with hope and courage". These was the words he spoke to
                        the
                        young crowd at a convocation in University of Lucknow in 1956.

                        He was also a friend and doctor of Mahatma Gandhi. Once when Gandhi was going under some fast
                        and
                        got unwell, Dr. Roy came with some medicine to treat him and Gandhi refused to take those
                        medicines
                        citing they are not Made in India and also told Dr. Roy that why don't he treats the fellow
                        Indian
                        citizens free?
                        In reply of this, Dr. Roy said to Gandhi "I have come here to treat someone who represents the
                        four
                        hundred million people of my country" and Gandhi accepted his medicines.

                        Post Independence in India, Congress Party proposed his name for Chief Minister of Bengal, which
                        he
                        refused but later accepted after Gandhiji's advice and became the Chief Minister of Bengal on 23
                        January, 1948. Bengal was seeing a pool of problems including communal violence, food shortage,
                        large flow of refugees in Bengal, unemployment etc. Dr. Roy did an amendable work by reuniting
                        the
                        party ranks, worked for every aspects he could and within 3 years normalcy settled down in
                        Bengal.


                        Just after receiving the most prestigious award of Bharat Ratna in 1961, one year later he died
                        on 1
                        July 1962 on his 80th birthday. He had gifted his house to be run as a nursing home in the name
                        of
                        his mother, Aghorkamini Devi. He had also formed a trust for his properties in Patna to carry
                        out
                        social service, with Ganga Sharan Singh, a eminent nationalist, being it's first trustee.

                        In memory of his excellence, The B. C. Roy National Award was introduced in 1962 and has been
                        awarding people for their excellent contributions in the field of medicine, politics, science,
                        philosophy, literature and arts, annually since 1976.</p>
                    <p>Jyoti Basu, (cofounder of Communist Party of India) who almost became the Prime Minister.

                        Jyoti Basu was the Chief Minister of Bengal from 1977 to 2000, for a record 23 years 4 months 17
                        days. He is known as the beacon of communism in Bengal. He would be the India's first Bengali
                        and
                        Marxist Prime Minister if CPI(M) hadn't decided to not join the government. 

                        He was born at 43/1 Harrison Road Calcutta (Now Mahatma Gandhi Road). His father was a doctor at
                        Bardi village, Dhaka (Now Bangladesh).

                        His birth name was Jyotirindra Basu but his father changed his name in school and he became
                        Jyoti
                        Basu. He completed his bachelors in English Literature from Presidency College in Kolkata and
                        did
                        Law from England.

                        Having developed a strong belief in the Communist ideals, Basu returned to India in 1940 and
                        joined
                        the Communist Party of India, he also became the secretary of the Friends of the Soviet Union
                        and
                        Anti-Fascist Writers’ and Artists’ Association in Calcutta.

                        In 1944, Basu started working with trade and railways unions of Bengal. He established the
                        Bengal
                        Nagpur Railway Workers’ Union, and became its General Secretary. He was elected to the central
                        committee of the CPI Bengal in 1951.

                        Communist Party of India knew the loss and corruption done by congress, they formed an
                        anti-congress
                        front with Socialist Republican Paarty, Bolshevik Party of India and the Forward Bloc, no doubt
                        Jyoti Basu was a member of this front.

                        After the India-China War of 1962, differences arose in the CPI, leading Basu co-found 
                        Communist
                        Party of India (Marxist).


                        When Basu came into power as a Chief Minister of Bengal, it was congress in ruling before him.
                        Basu
                        was a hardcore democratic supporter, he ordered probes into many matters which occurred during
                        the
                        previous congress govt. such as inordinate increase in prices of essential commodities, release
                        of
                        political prisoners, atrocities against anyone done by govt. He abolished the nefarious
                        Maintenance
                        of Internal Security Act which gave a full hand to the Congress govt to arrest anyone on mere
                        suspicions in the name of security. 


                        As the Chief Minister, he from the beginning took bold reforming steps for Bengal. He
                        industrialized
                        programs for small, medium and cottage industries. Unemployment allowances, stoppage of
                        retrenchment
                        of workers, cutting down on the tax of essential commodities.

                        When Jyoti Basu started administrating Bengal, within 3years, nearly more than 10 lakh acre more
                        ceiling surplus land was identified and three-fourth of this land was distributed within a year.
                        This resulted in a distribution of  surplus lands to landless people at such a large scale alone
                        in
                        Bengal, than that of few states of India combined to date. Bengal was the only state which put a
                        ceiling on landholding from the beginning which Basu changed after coming to a ruling position.

                        His innovative strategy was to take administration to village levels, where someone with oral
                        evidence could challenge the paper evidence in courts, and the powerful landlords could not
                        illegally acquired the lands anymore.
                        All measures of land reforms were taken together by Basu including distribution of homestead 
                        lands.


                        It was a golden period for Bengal in 1980s when Bengal was marching ahead with a 4.2% highest
                        annual
                        rate of foodgrain growth comparing to other states at 2.5% average. 


                        According to National Sample Survey, when CPI(M) came in rule with Basu as Chief Minister, it
                        was
                        40% of the population of whole Bengal who could not spend enough money to get 1800 calories
                        energy.
                        After 15 years to this time, Bengal saw a 17% decrease in this population. This was the biggest
                        reduction of extreme poverty anywhere in India over any period.
                        In the rural areas it dropped from 67% to 42% in fifteen years.

                        After the incident of Babri Mosque demolition, there was a rise of communal violence elsewhere
                        in
                        the country including the capital Delhi in 1984, but Bengal remained free of any communal
                        violence,
                        which is seen as a major achievement of Jyoti Basu's ruling period.


                        He had brought big initiatives in the history of Bengal, such as land reforms, minimum wages for
                        agricultural labourers, a three-tier panchayati system, dole for the unemployed and widows, and
                        the
                        establishment of a separate department for youth services. 

                        Basu retired from politics in 2000, though he remained a member of the CPI(M) politburo till
                        2008.

                    <p>For the traveler with limited time, the best way to explore Calcutta is roughly to trace the
                        route of
                        the Hooghly, meandering on and off the main thoroughfares by foot, tram and subway, known here
                        as
                        the Metro. This is not a luxury destination. It is more a journey through the grimy layers of
                        time.
                        History is inscribed on every lane, like tattoos on a body. Calcutta was once quite a diva.</p>
                    <p>On the left side of Calcutta the iron trusses of Howrah Bridge towers over the Hooghly river. The
                        pale yellow waters are dotted by Bengali canopy boats and you see occasional steel riverboats
                        ferrying passengers from Howrah Railway Station to Fairlie Place in Kolkata side across the
                        river.
                        An alighting passenger has to walk just a block across Fairlie Palace, and he will see a grand
                        red
                        greco roman styled three storied building that holds keys to the power in West Bengal. On the
                        first
                        floor of the building towards the old Calcutta Stock Exchange lies the chambers of the Chief
                        Minister.</p>
                    <p>The atmosphere in Kolkata is set to turn political as we are inching towards 2021. Most subjects
                        being discussed in Nabanna must be concerning the state elections to be held next year. It,
                        however,
                        serves as a temporary State Secretariat to West bengal. The original Secretariat is a 150-meter
                        long
                        building that covers the entire northern stretch of the iconic Lal Dighi pond in the downtown
                        area
                        of B.B.D. Bagh called the Writers’ building or just the Writers. The building with historical
                        importance has a distinct Greco-Roman style, with several statues of Greek gods as well as a
                        sculpture of Roman goddess Minerva that constitutes the prime attraction of this historical
                        heritage.

                        The building, as of today, has been under renovation since October 2013.</p>

                    <p>As a young firebrand 29 year old, she caught attention of political pundits by defeating a

                        of the communist party, Mr Somnath Chatterji in the central parliamentary elections in 1984 in

                        aftermath of sympathy wave generated due to assassination of Indira Gandhi representing Congress
                        Party.


                        Later in 1997 the veteran leaders in Congress Party could not hold her, and she split to form
                        her

                        and by 2011 she entered Writers Building as a Chief Minister. It was kind of a reversal of

                        as she was dragged out forcefully from the same corridors in 1993 during a protest against

                    <p>Establishment of Calcutta, now called as Kolkata in modern independent India, was a long and
                        messy
                        ordeal for the British East India Company. Calcutta, as we know it, didn’t exist as a city back
                        then. Infact, what we know as Calcutta today was actually formed by 
                        merging a cluster of three small  villages; Sutanutti, Kalikata & Gobindpur. Job Charnok, who
                        was an
                        employee & an administrator in the British East India Company, is largely credited for the
                        formation
                        of the Calcutta.

                        The British East India company first came to Calcutta in the period of Ibrahim Khan( 1617-1624)
                        the
                        Subahdar Governor of Bengal at the time when Mughal Emperor Jahangir was ruling. They first
                        setup
                        factories in the city of Surat( 1620) and then later in Agra. Scouts were sent across the area
                        to
                        find out more suitable places to setup trade bases, though this plan was soon abandoned due to
                        logistical reasons. In January 1644, Emperor Jahangir’s daughter got severely burned in a
                        unfortunate incident when a British doctor named Gabriel Boughton was called upon for treatment.
                        Boughton was successfully able to treat the Emperor’s daughter for which as a reward the British
                        EIC
                        were allowed to establish a factory in Pipilli, Oddisha. This was the first time English ships
                        arrived at Eastern ports. Boughton’s medical services were availed again by the new Subedar of
                        Bengal, and in return the company was allowed to establish factories in Balasore, Odisha and
                        Hooghly, Bengal.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Emperor Aurangzeb was the one sitting on throne during the major period of tension and conflict
                        between the Mughals and the British East India Company. The EIC wanted to establish a trade base
                        on
                        the eastern shore of India because of its strategic trading and military advantages. 


                        In the year 1982 when Shaista Khan, the Governer of Bengal, was going to Delhi the EIC requested
                        him
                        to ask the Emperor to give permission to permanently trade in Bengal. Till this point they were
                        allowed to open factories in multiple places, but British couldn't be sure of their position.
                        The
                        Emperor was pleased to provide them with a Firman and this event was celebrated with 300 gun
                        shots
                        in Hoogly. Though one shouldn't be fooled by this happy start to the agreement, this was the
                        start
                        of a very long & painful cat and mouse chase between both.


                        Tensions started arising soon, as the Firman granted wasn't very clear. A conflict with a local
                        zamindar ended resulted in a putting a few Englishmen behind bars. Further the EIC requested the
                        state to give them a permission to build a fort on the mouth of Hooghly on the grounds of
                        protecting
                        their trade. But Shaista Khan didn't trust the intentions of British, he knew letting them build
                        a
                        fort right on the mouth of Hoogly would make the Mughals a little more vulnerable. Upon hearing
                        this
                        request he immediately turned it down and imposed another 3.5% tax on top of the agreed 3000
                        rupees,
                        breaking the Firni.


                        The company got very enraged with this situation and requested King James II in the year 1685 to
                        permit the use of force against the Mughals. The plan was to attack Chittagong, fortify it and
                        make
                        an alliance with the King of Arakan who was against the Mughals. Jon Carmock, who was in the
                        Madras
                        division at that time was told to join this expedition along with 400 soldiers from Madras
                        division.
                        The plan went awry though; because of high winds and bad weather conditions a lot of the ships
                        ended
                        up in Hoogly instead of Chittagong. Upon seeing large number of battle ships on the bank,
                        Governer
                        Shaista Khan got alarmed and immediately offered them truce. This didn't last long though, there
                        was
                        a dispute between British troops and the Mughal troops which led to an altercation between them
                        and
                        the latter beat the crap out of the former. The admiral then opened up fire on the city burning
                        down
                        500 houses; a property loss of about 30 lakh rupees. Upon Shaista Khan immediately sent troops
                        to
                        drive out the British from the area and capture all their factories and assets.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The historical city of Murshidabad-the earstwhile nawabi capital –a city founded in the year 1704
                        by
                        Murshid Quli Khan, the Mughal diwan of Bengal. In 1704 Murshid Quli Khan had transferred the
                        capital
                        of Bengal from Dhaka to Murshidabad which he  named the city after his name .The town is
                        situated on
                        the left bank of river Bhagirathi.  Under the Nawabs Murshidabad’s glory reached to the highest
                        peak
                        in almost all arenas. As a trading centre Murshidabad became famous. Many scholars came here
                        ,settled and mixed with the local people freely and hence there developed a cosmopolitan
                        culture. By
                        the middle of the 18th century Murshidabad became one of the greatest centres of culture and
                        education as the nawabs were the patrons of the learned.</p>
                    <p>In the Nawabi period Bengali literature also flourished .The learned men of this period made a 
                        great
                        contribution in Urdu, Hindi, Persian literature. We ought to mention the Sufi literature of this
                        period .For the expansion of Islam Sufi litterateurs wrote books in Bengali to make the common
                        men
                        understand the Islamic knowledge and education. This proves that the state of education under
                        the
                        nawabs was excellent. During this period a different stream of Bengali language,Musalmani
                        Bangla,
                        arose  which is a mix of Peresian, Urdu and Bengali languages. There was also a different form
                        of
                        literature ,mixed languages, which was popular among the lower section of the society. The elite
                        were less influenced by this literature. Persian was the official language of the era. The
                        Muslims
                        and Hindus both practiced this language which gave them the opportunity for a job in the
                        government
                        departments. Under the nawabs Murshidabad gained eminent position in the fields of education and
                        culture. Ghulam Hussain gives a long list of learned men, physicians, mathematicians and other
                        scholarly persons from this we can assume that educational institutions were there at
                        Murshidabad
                        during the period of review .Murshid Quli Khan established a Madrasha for the uplift of the
                        education. This institution , Kara Madrasha, as it was used as a guest house and was also
                        maintained
                        by the nawab.</p>

                    <p>While Britishers first entered into India from the west the true expansion and seeds of
                        colonialism
                        were sown in the east, particularly from Bengal. It was the year 1775 when a young British
                        governor
                        named Robert Clive must return to India as the governor of Fort St. David with a mission to
                        uproot
                        French administration from India. However, destiny must pull his attention towards Calcutta (now
                        Kolkata), a city that was rivaling Madras as a major trade centre in India. Clive knew the
                        strategic
                        importance and opportunities associated with Calcutta which, however, was under the
                        administration
                        of Siraj Al-Dawlah, the then Mughal viceroy of Bengal. For decades Britishers have had a mutual
                        understanding and cooperation with the Mughals. In order to strengthen British administration in
                        Bengal the new governor must make a decision. Clive decides to fortify the city. In response,
                        Clive
                        receives a brutal retaliation from Siraj Al-Dawlah who attacked and captured the fort.      


                        Fall of Calcutta was a major setback for the British empire. It was perhaps Clive’s biggest
                        challenge to wrest Calcutta back from Mughals and to restore British supremacy in the region. An
                        angry and humiliated British governor had decided to establish British dominance in the region
                        and
                        restore British honor. An army of 900 Europeans and 1500 Indian soldiers marched towards
                        Calcutta
                        and recaptured it on January 2, 1757. The nawab is humiliated and forced to pay compensation and
                        let
                        the British fortify the city. Six months later, the humiliated nawab declares war against the
                        British popularly known as the Battle of Plassey. However, it was a one sided war where British
                        cannons unleashed havoc on the Siraj’s army. Clive overthroned Siraj and replaced him with Mīr
                        Jaʿfar, an elderly general secretly hostile to Sirāj al-Dawlah. With Mir Ja’far under his
                        influence,
                        Clive virtually became the master of the Bengal province. The event marked the advent of British
                        empire in India. 


                        The same Britishers in 1905, however, partitioned Bengal which came to be known as the first
                        partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, then viceroy of India. The partition was done for
                        territorial
                        reorganization of the Bengal Presidency. The partition separated the largely Muslim eastern
                        areas
                        from the largely Hindu western areas. The sentiments of a separate state on the basis of
                        religion,
                        faith and language were sown. 


                        It's the year 1929, in a primary school in Gopalganj district, a young boy is protesting against
                        the
                        removal of his school principal for his hostile behavior against students. He organized a
                        student
                        union in order to achieve so. Such protests and rebels against any injustice were soon to become
                        a
                        part of his political career ahead for he was to become Bangabandhu Mujibur Rehman, the father
                        of
                        Bangladesh. 




                        “Amar desh tomar desh..Bangladesh Bangladesh”
                        “Amar desh tomar desh..Bangladesh Bangladesh”


                        “My country. Your country. Bangladesh Bangladesh”. Surrounded by a huge mass gathering in Dhaka
                        in
                        the year 1971, angered by the negligence and hostility of the West Pakistan army and government
                        Mujibur Rehman, this time well popular and experienced is marching towards the podium to address
                        his
                        supporters. Since the inception of Pakistan in 1947, west Pakistan had a racist approach towards
                        the
                        people of East Pakistan. Pre-independance Mujib supported Jinnah's idea of partition of India on
                        the
                        basis of religion. But his hero turned villain when post independence Jinnah forced Urdu as the
                        only
                        official language of the whole of Pakistan which included its east counterpart as well. Mujib
                        protested. 


                        Mujib’s rebellious behavior against west Pakistan marked a new phase in his political career
                        which
                        irked many in the west who were actually in power. From 1947 to 1971, jail became his second
                        home.
                        He opposed the biased behavior of his west counterparts towards Bangla people. 
                        In 1958, General Ayub Khan declared martial law in the country. This period saw a significant
                        rise
                        of Islamic fundamentalism and degrading humanitarian rights and law especially towards the
                        people of
                        East Pakistan. After almost a decade of violence and distrust against Bangla people, in 1966,
                        Mujib
                        gave up the hope of equal status with western counterparts and demanded full autonomy for East
                        Pakistan in the form of Our Charter of Survival from West Pakistan. His demands, however, were
                        outrageous - a separate stock exchange and army to name few. The charter must have made
                        Pakistani
                        Generals either laugh or fume over it. Because Mujib was indirectly asking for a separate
                        country.


                        Nevertheless, Mujib was again arrested, invoking huge mass protests in East Pakistan for his
                        release
                        scaring the Pakistan army of a civil war. They agreed to release Mujib unconditionally. When
                        Mujib
                        reached Dhaka he was welcomed by people with great emotions and support for him. Surrounded
                        amongst
                        thousands of supporters he was conferred Bangabandhu or the friend of Bangla.


                        Finally, in 1970, the decade-long martial law was lifted and the general elections were
                        announced.
                        The results, however, invited more political unrest in Pakistan. Mujib’s Awami league came
                        victorious but were denied to form a government. Tensions between East Pakistan and West
                        Pakistan
                        rose to all time high. Under these situations Mujib retaliated by calling for full autonomy and
                        independence. He gave the slogan of “Joy Bangla” and declared independence. The ideology of
                        Bangladesh was formed.


                        He was again arrested, this time, on the charges of sedition. To suppress civil support for him
                        Pakistan army launched Operation Searchlight which even today is remembered as one of the most
                        barbaric and inhuman assaults on citizens. Thousands of people were killed, women raped,
                        children
                        crushed on the roads. Streets and houses of Dhaka were painted in red by the blood stains of
                        innocent Banglas. The Pakistan army men infiltrated each and every house of East Pakistanis and
                        launched fire. To this menace the people had no choice but to evade their homeland and flee to
                        more
                        secure neighbouring Indian states. 


                        Thousands of East Pakistani crossed the border to find refuge in east India. It was the largest
                        humanitarian refugee crisis of that time. The sudden incursion of refugees alarmed people
                        sitting in
                        New Delhi. It was no more an internal issue of Pakistan. In the winters of 1971, Indira Gandhi,
                        the
                        then Prime Minister of India, declared war with Pakistan to support the local Bangla freedom
                        fighters called the Mukti Vahini. Field Marshal General Sam Manekshaw was given the
                        responsibility
                        to liberate Bangladesh from the brutalities of the west Pakistani regime. 13 days later about
                        91000
                        Pakistani soldiers surrendered to India. Yahiya Khan resigned. Under international pressure the
                        Pakistan government released Mujibur Rehman on 8th January, 1972. Bangladesh was born and
                        Mujibur
                        Rehman emerged as first the President and later the Prime Minister of Bangladesh.</p>
                    <p>The same Britishers in 1905, however, partitioned Bengal which came to be known as the first
                        partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, then viceroy of India. The partition was done for
                        territorial
                        reorganization of the Bengal Presidency. The partition separated the largely Muslim eastern
                        areas
                        from the largely Hindu western areas. The sentiments of a separate state on the basis of
                        religion,
                        faith and language were sown. 


                        It's the year 1929, in a primary school in Gopalganj district, a young boy is protesting against
                        the
                        removal of his school principal for his hostile behavior against students. He organized a
                        student
                        union in order to achieve so. Such protests and rebels against any injustice were soon to become
                        a
                        part of his political career ahead for he was to become Bangabandhu Mujibur Rehman, the father
                        of
                        Bangladesh.</p>
                    <p>The election result of 1971 was  not honoured, leading to a civil war on March 26, and Sheikh
                        Mujib
                        declared Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan . The declaration coincided with a ruthless
                        show of
                        strength by the Pakistani military, in which tanks rolled out on the streets of Dhaka and
                        several
                        students and intellectuals were killed. 
                        A woman only 13, had already learned to fear people around her. She saw her father being to
                        death.One day in late afternoon people barged into her house. They snatched her two little
                        brothers,
                        tied them to a tree and beat them.She ran out of the front door , but the men caught her. They
                        tethered her arms to two trees. They ripped off her earrings and bracelets, and stripped off her
                        clothes.


                        Between 300,000 and 3,000,000 people were killed and around 200,000 to 400,000 women were raped.


                        India under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided full support to Rahman and Bangladesh’s
                        independence movement, resulting in the creation of a sovereign government at Dhaka in January
                        1971.

                        “Amar desh tomar desh..Bangladesh Bangladesh”


                        “My country. Your country. Bangladesh Bangladesh”. Surrounded by a huge mass gathering in Dhaka
                        in
                        the year 1971, angered by the negligence and hostility of the West Pakistan army and government
                        Mujibur Rehman, this time well popular and experienced, is marching towards the podium to
                        address
                        his supporters. Since the inception of Pakistan in 1947, west Pakistan had a racist approach
                        towards
                        the people of East Pakistan. Pre-independance Mujib supported Jinnah's idea of partition of
                        India on
                        the basis of religion. But soon, his national hero and ideal turned villain when post
                        independence
                        Jinnah announced Urdu as the only official language of the whole of Pakistan which included its
                        east
                        counterpart as well. Mujib protested.</p>
                    <p>One of the great grandsons of Mir Zafar was Iskandar Mirza, who assumed the first Presidency of
                        Pakistan after giving his country a constitution in 1956, full 9 years after Pakistan's
                        Independence. A proud and stout Bengali, he found it  difficult to get along with the Prime
                        Ministers he appointed. Like a musical game of chairs, he changed four Prime Ministers in his
                        Presidency from March of 1956 to October of 1958. His third Prime Minister was Huseyn Suhrawady,
                        an
                        influential Bengali Muslim freedom fighter who also once held Prime Ministership of united
                        Bengal
                        province during Britsh times.</p>

                    <p>Sheikh Hasina was sworn in as prime minister of Bangladeh in January 2009. In 2017, in the midst
                        of
                        Hasina's premiership, more than 700,000 Rohingya  arrived in Bangladesh, fleeing genocide  in
                        neighbouring Myanmar . 
                        The Bangladesh government provided refuge and assistance, however, it did not grant refugee
                        status
                        and worked to repatriate the Rohingyas on a voluntary basis. 
                        Hasina's government received praise both internationally and domestically for helping the
                        Rohingya.
                        In past years Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in discussion with West Bengal Chief
                        Minister Mamata Banerjee to discuss a range of bilateral issues.
                        The Teesta river water sharing issue was discussed by the two leaders and New Delhi and Dhaka
                        both
                        are keen to seal an agreement on it since September 2011.
                        Sheikh Hasina has time and again acknowledged the friendly and cordial relation between the two
                        countries to continue and flourish.</p>
                    <p>Under Hasina, Bangladesh has made significant strides towards educating girls and giving women a
                        greater voice, both in the household and the public sphere whose efforts have translated into
                        improvements in children’s health and education, such that Bangladeshis’ average life expectancy
                        is
                        now 72 years, compared to 68 for Indians and 66 for Pakistanis.
                        The Bangladesh government deserves credit for supporting grass-roots initiatives in economic
                        inclusion which includes Bangladeshi adults with bank accounts, 34.1% made digital transactions
                        in
                        2017, compared to an average rate of 27.8% for South Asia. 
                        Hasina’s government has offered a better environment for manufacturing firms to achieve
                        economies of
                        scale and create a large number of jobs, and though Bangladesh still needs much stronger
                        regulation
                        to protect workers from occupational hazards, the absence of which curtails labour-market
                        flexibility has been a boon for job creation and manufacturing success.</p>
                    <p>Mamta Banerjee has also extended her support to Sheikh Hasina by protesting Modi's govt on CAB
                        and
                        NRC Bill. 
                        Mamta's stand on the above issue explains why the bilateral relation between Hasina and her is
                        going
                        to last long.</p>

                    <p>The dynamics of democratic politics in West Bengal, a major state of eastern India had taken its
                        own
                        shape despite some aberrations due to the politics of violence in the sixties. Whenever there
                        has
                        been any communication gap between the ruling party and the people, as it occurred during
                        1964-66
                        and again during 1974-76, the electorate democratically registered its protest at the next
                        available
                        opportunity by rejecting the imperious attitude of the ruling party .Such a gap has been very
                        much
                        bridged by the direct and personal type of leadership adopted by the left politicians
                        ideological
                        slant of the political process in West Bengal has, in general, prevented the growth of regional
                        patriotism or politics Of parochialism, except for the minor political impact left by Ghisingh
                        and
                        his GNLF movement. It is one of the sings of politics in West Bengal.</p>
                    <p>The elected Leftist coalition since 1977 (often described as sound ‘political stability’), but
                        also
                        because of its widely acknowledged successes in fertility transition, execution of
                        re-distributive
                        land reform and political decentralization programmes. Ironically, yet, the state, in almost all
                        comparative assessments of social, human and infrastructural developments occupies a lagged
                        position
                        vis-à-vis many other states, especially in the south and even against all-India records. A
                        well-disciplined grassroots political mobilization network, and the machinery of the Left Front
                        parties, have been highly instrumental for comparatively fast declines of fertility and
                        population
                        growth and for lasting political stability in an otherwise ‘dilatory’ development regime.
                        However, a
                        government geared to ensuring mass electoral support overwhelmingly via a grassroots
                        mobilization
                        network but, with a relative neglect of social movements, economic infrastructure and human
                        development, is likely to suffer adverse consequences in the longer term.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>The ripple effects of Russian revolution in 1917 reached British India that was fighting against
                        a
                        similar “class” ideology. Consequently, in 1925 the foundation of communism was set in Kanpur.
                        However, due to weak leadership and dominance of Gandhian philosophy, communism in India was
                        finding
                        it difficult to sustain its roots in Indian politics. 20 years later, a young Jyoti Basu was
                        attending the lectures of Harold Laski, a prominent member of the British Labour Party turned
                        Marxist. This small event was going to change everything in Basu’s ideological philosophy as
                        well as
                        Indian politics in future. In the years that followed, Basu’s activities in politics
                        significantly
                        increased and, in 1939, selected as the General Secretary of the London Majlis he came into
                        contact
                        with prominent Indian political leaders like Nehru and Bose. He returned to India in 1940 and
                        joined
                        the Communist Party of India.</p>
                    <p>At the time of independence, all of India from north to south was governed popularly by one
                        party,
                        the Indian National Congress. Bengal was no different. Basu realized that if he had to establish
                        communist ideology in Bengal he must establish communications with the lower sections of the
                        society
                        especially with farmers and peasants. He got this opportunity in the form of Te-Bhag movement
                        under
                        which small farmers united against the zamindars or the landlords with the demand to only give
                        one-third of the land tax. The movement was heavily supported by CPI led by Jyoti Basu. Over the
                        years he established various worker unions and also played a pivotal role in uniting various
                        communist parties (like the Forward Bloc, the Socialist Replublican party and the United
                        Socialist
                        party) all across India to build an anti-Congress front. However, after the Sino-India war in
                        1962
                        CPI split into two parts - CPI(Marxist) and CPI(Maoist) following ideological differences.</p>
                    <p>The influence of CPI(M) in Bengal gave a stiff competition to Congress and in 1977 when CPI(M)
                        came
                        to power Jyoti Basu served a (then) record 23 years as the Chief Minister of Bengal. The prime
                        reason for such a long tenure of communism in Bengal can be found in its basic ideology which
                        stands
                        up for the rights of workers class. Under his long 33 years tenure Jyoti basu made several
                        landmark
                        reforms for the deprived class. Empowering villages from grassroot level by empowering the
                        Panchayat
                        System, boosting labour reforms and land reforms were among few of them which tightened his
                        political grip on the socially backward class. His secular personality further improved his
                        image
                        amongst people of all backgrounds and race.</p>
                    <p>Operation Barga was a land reform movement throughout rural West Bengal for recording the names
                        of
                        sharecroppers (bargadars) while avoiding the time-consuming method of recording through the
                        settlement machinery. It bestowed on the bargadars, the legal protection against eviction by the
                        landlords, and entitled them to the due share of the produce. Operation Barga was launched in
                        1978
                        and concluded by the mid-1980s.


                        Introduced in 1978, and given legal backing in 1979 and 1980, Operation Barga became a popular
                        but
                        controversial measure for land reforms. The ultimate aim of these land reforms was to facilitate
                        the
                        conversion of the state's bargadars into landowners. To date, Op Barga has recorded the names of
                        approximately 1.5 million bargadars. Since then, it has been marked as one of the more
                        successful
                        land reforms programs in India.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>From time Immemorial the State in India has claimed a certain proportion of the produce of every
                        bigha or acre of land. The laws of Manu declare that a king is entitled to an eighth, a sixth,
                        or a
                        twelfth of the gross product. according to the difference of the soil and the labours necessary
                        to
                        cultivate it: in times of emergency, even a fourth. Alauddin Khilji levied a tax equal to half
                        the
                        gross produce of the lands in his kingdom. Under Sher Shah and Akbar the share of the State was
                        a
                        third; thereafter the demand increased, reaching up to a half.


                        Land Revenue was the chief source of public income in India till 1916.</p>
                    <p>The word Zemindar means literally a land-holder. In Bengal the Mughal conquerors used the term to
                        denote those persons, drawn from almost every level of society, whom they employed to collect
                        the
                        revenue from the land. In lieu of salaries, these zemindars were given grants of land free from
                        revenue, and allowed to retain a specified portion of the collections, to levy transit duties,
                        and
                        to dispose of the waste lands. In origin, ilierefore, the zemindari tenure in Bengal was an
                        official
                        one. Its sole foundation was the sanad, or charter of appointment. Its essential feature was the
                        collection and transmission of public revenue. In the heyday of Mughal ride sanads were often
                        revoked on failure to render prompt payments. Some zemindars, it is true, succeeded in
                        stabilising
                        their position, and claimed a customary and prescriptive right to collect the revenue. But this
                        in
                        itself did not divest the zemindari tenure of its official character; for under the Mughals all
                        offices tended to become hereditary.</p>
                    <p>Ijarah System was introduced in Mughal empire under Jahandhar Shah by Zulfiqar Khan.


                        Under this system the government gave the right to collect tax revenue on production to a third
                        party (middle man) and in return got an assured sum from the third party. The third party could
                        levy
                        any percentage of tax on the people.


                        This was different from the earlier system as incase of the older system tax was collected at a
                        fixed rate (fixed by the state) and could not be arbitrarily changed by individuals/tax
                        officials.


                        Ijarah system exposed the population to a tyrranous tax system because they were left at the
                        mercy
                        of the middlemen who continuously exploited them.</p>
                    <p>Revenue system of Mauryan Empire was devised by the Minister of Chandragupta Maurya, Kautilya.
                        The
                        principal items of revenue in town and country have been listed by Kautilya while describing the
                        duties of the Samaharta (collector-general). 


                        The main heads of revenue were:   A share of land output. Other dues and cesses levied on land
                        including a water-rate. The water rate varied according to the nature of the land and crop and
                        tax
                        on houses in towns. Income from crown lands, from forests, from mines and manufactures, some of
                        them
                        monopolies like salt, undertaken by government  Customs at the frontiers and tariffs, tolls and
                        ferry dues in the interior levied on merchandise in transport Profits of coinage and gains from
                        trade operations carried on by the government  Fees for licenses of various kinds to be taken
                        out by
                        artisans, craftsmen, professionals and traders  Fines levied in law courts and  Miscellaneous
                        receipts like presents like transferred possession.                                             
                        In
                        emergency 'benevolences' were resorted to and the rich had to pay considerable amounts to the
                        state
                        under. Mauryas introduced images with a view to gain gold. Granting exemptions from payment of
                        revenue was common particularly land-revenue to Brahmins and religious institutions and to
                        state-officials. A register of such remissions and assignments was maintained.                 
                           
                                                     Industries were taxed, using a vast mix of techniques, all of which
                        were derived from the original land revenue tax system. This entire system was the creation of
                        Kautilya, the prime minister of Chandragupta Maurya. As the taxation system developed the
                        government
                        had money to further develop the kingdom. The government also introduced state owned farms where
                        the
                        king owned the land and his subjects were employed for its cultivation. The government had the
                        resources to organize the procedure and once the land was ready it would employ the cultivator
                        to
                        work on the land.                                                   The Mauryas had developed
                        extensive trade relations. There were many foreign traders who took up residence in Mauryan
                        cities.
                        There were a variety of goods being exported thereby generating revenue. The exports were items
                        of
                        luxury like fine muslin cloth. The development of trade became profitable for the empire and
                        eventually a separate department looked after trade and commerce.  Land revenue of Mauryan
                        Empire   
                                               Land revenues from the rural areas were appropriated in the form of crown
                        lands (sita), land revenue (bhaga) from cultivators, taxes on orchards, ferry charges and so
                        on. 


                        Different types of taxes that were imposed on rural population are:  
                        (i) Bhaga - It was levied at the rate of one-fourth to one-sixth. Sharecroppers and other
                        agricultural support by the state had to pay half of the produce to the state.    \(ii)
                        Pindikara -
                        It was a tax levied on groups of villages and paid by farmers. This was customary. Often the
                        villages were supposed to supply provisions to the royal army when they pass through their
                        respective territories.    
                        (iii) Hiranya - It was a tax paid in cash.    
                        (iv) Bali - This was popular in the Vedic times and continued under the Mauryas.    
                        (v) Pranaya - This literally means a gift of affection. It was levied imposed by the state
                        during
                        emergency. This was first mentioned by Panini, it was elaborated upon for the first time in
                        Arthashastra. Pranaya amounted to one-third or one-fourth of the produce according to the nature
                        of
                        the soil. 


                        Export-Import Tax:-                                      Import tax was 20 per cent, but there
                        is no
                        definite knowledge about the export tax. Import tax was called prabeshya, while export tax was
                        called nishkramya.  Sales Tax:-                The Sulkadhyaksha collected toll tax on every
                        item
                        before it was sold or purchased. There were three rates of toll tax or sale tax: 9.5 per cent on
                        iteIns sold on the basis of calculation; 5 per cent on the iteIns sold on the basis of
                        measurement;
                        and 6.5 per cent on items sold on the basis of weight. Income Tax:-                     
                        The following taxes were imposed on the sources of income in cities: (i) wine manufacturing tax;
                        (ii) salt manufacturing tax; (iii) taxes on ghee, oil and edible oil; (iv) taxes on animal
                        slaughterers; (v) taxes on artisans and artists; (vi) taxes on gamblers and gambling houses;
                        (vii)
                        taxes on prostitution, (viii) taxes on the income of temples; and (ix) taxes on additional
                        incomes
                        of the wage earners.</p>

                            reforms</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Lord William Bentinck was born in London, the second son of the 3rd Duke of Portland. He was
                        educated
                        at Rev. Dr Samuel Goodenough's school in Ealing, before moving on to Westminster School. After
                        completing his education, he embarked on a military career, moving swiftly up the ranks on
                        account
                        of his family's influence and his ability to purchase commissions.


                        In 1799, Lord William went to Italy, where he served for two years as liaison officer with the
                        Austro-Russian forces. In 1801 he embarked for Egypt to command the cavalry, but saw no active
                        service. His star continued to rise with his appointment, in 1803, as Governor of Madras. The
                        appointment had been secured largely by the lobbying of his father, but was not popular with the
                        East India Company and the Board of Control. Lord William had a number of significant
                        achievements
                        in India, but his work was largely overshadowed by the mutiny at Vellore in July 1806. He left
                        his
                        post in 1807.


                        In 1808 he served in the Battle of Corunna and by 1811 had been appointed envoy to the Court of
                        the
                        Two Sicilies. From here, he promoted plans for an independent and united Italy, until he was
                        recalled to Britain in 1815.


                        After a period at home in Britain when he served as a commissioner for drainage and navigation
                        in
                        the fens, he returned to India in 1828 as Governor General - a post which he then held until
                        1835.
                        In this role he undertook sweeping social, economic and political reforms which, it has been
                        argued,
                        laid the foundations for modern India.</p>
                    <p>He refused reappointment to the governorship of Madras in 1819, waiting to attain his real
                        ambition—the appointment as governor-general of Bengal, which came in 1827. Bentinck’s immediate
                        instructions were to rescue India from its financial difficulties; at this time the government
                        in
                        India operated on an annual deficit of about £1.5 million. Bentinck soon succeeded in turning
                        the
                        deficit into a surplus of about the same amount. The result of his efforts was the renewal of
                        the
                        East India Company’s government by the Charter Act of 1833, whereby Bentinck became the first
                        governor-general of India. He next turned to personnel reforms, which included making more
                        administrative and judicial positions available to Indians and improving the salaries and status
                        of
                        Indian judges. Bentinck also made English, instead of Persian, the language of the higher courts
                        and
                        of higher education and arranged for financial aid to colleges, which were to be adapted to the
                        Western models.


                        Bentinck showed great courage and humanity by his decision to abolish suttee (sati), the Hindu
                        custom of burning widows alive with the corpses of their husbands. Previous governors-general
                        had
                        shrunk from prohibiting the custom as an interference in religion and one particularly likely to
                        upset the Indian army, but Bentinck cut through these hesitations without facing much open
                        opposition. He was also responsible for the measures taken to suppress the murder of unwanted
                        children, human sacrifice, and the thags—bands of robbers, bound together by oaths and ritual,
                        who
                        murdered unsuspecting travelers in the name of the goddess Kālī. Flogging in the Indian army was
                        also abolished, long before it ended in the British army.</p>
                    <p>At his tenure Governor General of Bengal became  Governor General of  India. He was responsible
                        for
                        introduction of English as a language of instruction in India. He reformed the finances, opened
                        up
                        judicial posts to Indians, and suppressed such practices as suttee, or widow burning, and
                        thuggee,
                        or ritual murder by robber gangs</p>

                        colonial
                        authority and zamindari system by the Santhal people. It started on June 30, 1855 and on

                        created
                        a system of administration which proved successful in maintaining order.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Partition of Bengal, (1905), division of Bengal carried out by the British viceroy in India, Lord
                        Curzon, despite strong Indian nationalist opposition. It began a transformation of the Indian
                        National Congress from a middle-class pressure group into a nationwide mass movement.</p>
                    <p>Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa had formed a single province of British India since 1765. By 1900 the
                        province had grown too large to handle under a single administration. East Bengal, because of
                        isolation and poor communications, had been neglected in favour of west Bengal and Bihar. Curzon
                        chose one of several schemes for partition: to unite Assam, which had been a part of the
                        province
                        until 1874, with 15 districts of east Bengal and thus form a new province with a population of
                        31
                        million. The capital was Dacca (now Dhaka, Bangl.), and the people were mainly Muslim.


                        The Hindus of west Bengal, who controlled most of Bengal’s commerce and professional and rural
                        life,
                        complained that the Bengali nation would be split in two, making them a minority in a province
                        including the whole of Bihar and Orissa. They regarded the partition as an attempt to strangle
                        nationalism in Bengal, where it was more developed than elsewhere. Agitation against the
                        partition
                        included mass meetings, rural unrest, and a swadeshi (native) movement to boycott the import of
                        British goods. The partition was carried through despite the agitation, and the extreme
                        opposition
                        went underground to form a terrorist movement.</p>
                    <p>In 1898 it was announced that he would succeed Lord Elgin as viceroy of India, and, in September
                        of
                        that year, he was created Baron Curzon of Kedleston. He was the youngest viceroy of India in
                        history, and he cherished the prospect of it, for it was an office filled with the pomp and
                        ceremony
                        he loved. India was the most-treasured jewel in Queen Victoria’s crown, and, after the pageantry
                        of
                        his arrival in Calcutta on January 3, 1899, Curzon wrote: “I suddenly saw what had come into my
                        hands, and what prodigies of energy and inspiration would be needed on my part to guide them.”
                        He
                        demanded obedience and a bent knee from the rajas, maharajas, and provincial governors he now
                        ruled,
                        but there was no doubt of his sense of mission toward the Indian people. He initiated
                        commissions of
                        inquiry into education, police, and civil services; he reduced taxes; he ordered immediate
                        punishment of any Briton (including members of the army) who ill-treated Indian nationals. In
                        external affairs he paid special attention to India’s frontiers, toured the Persian Gulf, and
                        sent a
                        successful mission to Tibet to frustrate Russian ambitions there. On his return from what he
                        called
                        a “triumphal” tour of the Indian provinces, he ordered the restoration of the Taj Mahal, which
                        was
                        decaying, and thereafter took a personal interest in India’s artistic and cultural heritage.</p>
                    <p>At the end of his first five years in India, his successes were recognized by the government at
                        home
                        by a renewal of his term, but, in fact, the period of blazing glory was over and now came
                        political
                        tragedy. At Curzon’s personal request, the job of commander in chief of the Indian army and
                        military
                        member of the viceroy’s cabinet had been given to England’s military hero of the day, Lord
                        Kitchener
                        of Khartoum. Curzon believed that to have such an illustrious soldier on his staff would
                        embellish
                        his own image, though his friends in England warned him repeatedly that Kitchener was, in Lord
                        Esher’s words, “an uncouth and ruthless man.” It was a clash of personalities, and the two were
                        soon
                        unscrupulously intriguing against each other. A final confrontation between the two men, which
                        ended
                        in Curzon’s bursting into tears, brought matters to a climax. Curzon, confident that the
                        government
                        would take his part, cabled that either his views must be accepted or he would go. On the
                        morning of
                        August 16, 1905, he received a cable from King Edward VII telling him that his resignation had
                        been
                        accepted. He delayed his return to England, and, by the time he was once again in London, the
                        Tories
                        were out of office, and his Indian achievements had been forgotten. He was not even given the
                        earldom usually awarded to retiring viceroys.</p>
                    <p>In 1911, the year that the capital was shifted from Calcutta (now Kolkata) to Delhi, east and
                        west
                        Bengal were reunited; Assam again became a chief commissionership, while Bihar and Orissa were
                        separated to form a new province. The aim was to combine appeasement of Bengali sentiment with
                        administrative convenience. This end was achieved for a time, but the Bengali Muslims, having
                        benefitted from partition, were angry and disappointed. This resentment remained throughout the
                        rest
                        of the British period. The final division of Bengal at the partitioning of the subcontinent in
                        1947,
                        which split Bengal into India in the west and East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) in the east, was
                        accompanied by intense violence.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>B.C. Roy was a great planner for the improvement of education and culture of West Bengal. Due to
                        the
                        efforts of B.C. Roy Viswa Bharati, established by Rabindra Nath Tagore in 1921 was elevated as
                        Viswa
                        Bharati University under the Governance of the Government of India in 1951. It may be noted here
                        that the planning for the establishing of the above mentioned Kalyani University was initiated
                        by
                        B.C. Roy in 1954. It was B.C. Roy who took the special drive for the passing of the Jadavpur
                        University Bill in the Legislative Assembly in 1955. As a President of the National Education
                        Council, B.C. Roy himself moved the Jadavpur University Bill in the month of September 1955.
                        Jadavpur University was occasionally opened by Dr. Sarvapally Radhakrishan, the then Vice-
                        President
                        of India on 18th March 1956 for opening up a new era in the history of the higher education in
                        India
                        particularly in West Bengal. ‘Academy of Dance, Drama and Music’ was established in 1955. As a
                        result of B.C. Roy’s vision for commemorating to Gurudev Rabindra Nath Tagore a plan was
                        formulated
                        for establishing Rabindra Bharati University in 1959. He was also the founder President of
                        Indian
                        Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management in Calcutta.</p>
                    <p>Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first Education Minister of free India, was also the personal friend
                        of
                        Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal. In course of discussion between the two
                        the
                        former approached the later to locate a site for setting up one of the five regional engineering
                        colleges sometime in the year of 1950-51. The Chief Minister B.C. Roy accepted the offer at once
                        and
                        selected Hijli at Kharagpur in the district of Midnapur which is a distance of 100 miles from
                        Calcutta for the purpose of setting up engineering college. Due to the insistence of Maulana
                        Abul
                        Kalam Azad prior to the approval of I.I.T. Kharagpur B.C. Roy agreed to take overall charge of
                        the
                        Institute as its Chairman in his personal capacity. With the help of his personal sagacity and
                        indomitable spirit for doing something for the betterment of the state, B.C. Roy selected Jnan
                        Chandra Ghosh, an eminent scholar and scientist as its first Director.</p>
                    <p>His Bihar Bengal merger scheme with Srikrishna Sinha failed</p>
                    <p>One of the main causes behind the shortage of food was the partition of the country which gave
                        almost
                        20 million acres of excellent rice-growing paddy fields to the East Pakistan and thereby rice
                        became
                        comparatively unavailable and more expensive in West Bengal. In addition the influx of lakhs of
                        refugees from East Pakistan to West Bengal, diversion of 200,000 acres of rice growing lands to
                        jute
                        cultivation and damage of crops due to natural calamities - collectively resulted in a yearly
                        deficit of 200,000 tons food grain in the state.</p>
                    <p>Zamindari Abolition Bill There were some important Bills relating to the land system passed
                        during
                        the chief ministership of B.C. Roy. In the ‘Bargaders Acts’ of 1950 some provisions were there
                        to
                        protect the share croppers. According to the Acts a ‘share croppers conflict –removal board’ was
                        set
                        up. Not only that ‘Zamindari Accusation Acts, and ‘Land Reforms Acts’ were passed in 1953 and
                        1955
                        respectively. According to the ‘Zamindari Accusation Acts of 1953, the permanent settlement and
                        Zamindari systems were declared null and void. There were provisions to give compensations to
                        the
                        Zamindars. However, on and from 1st Baishak, 1362 (Bengali Callender) i.e.1955  155 the
                        accusation
                        of Zamindari was started by the Government of West Bengal. The shares of the share-croppers were
                        fixed 60% instead of tebhaga i.e. 2/3. It was circulated that the owner of the vested lands
                        would be
                        allowed to retain 25 acres of cultivable lands and 15 acres of housing as well as garden lands.
                        Measures were taken to distribute the surplus lands among the share croppers and landless
                        peasants.
                        The abolition of Zamindari system by the West Bengal Government in 1953, marked the beginning of
                        one
                        of the most revolutionary measures in the history of the land reforms in the country to stop
                        exploitation of peasantry by the landlords.173With the passage of the Bill the power and
                        prestige of
                        the landed aristocracy began to decline steadily. The Zamindars started selling their palatial
                        buildings which they could no longer maintain. In that connection, the State Government was
                        advised
                        by the Central Government to examine the cases and purchase such properties for utilization of
                        nation- building purpose.</p>
                    <p>As Chief Minister of West Bengal, he laid the foundation of five cities, namely, Durgapur,
                        Kalyani,
                        Bidhannagar, Ashokenagar and Habra.</p>
                    <p>In the obituary to Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, the British Medical Journal wrote, “… at his
                        professional
                        zenith, he may have had the largest consulting practice in the world, news of his visit to a
                        city or
                        even railway station bringing forth hordes of would-be patients.”</p>
