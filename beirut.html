                    <p>Beirut is the capital of Lebanon and also the largest city of the country. On a peninsula at the
                        midpoint of the Lebanon’s Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important regional seaport. 


                         Recently, during the novel corona virus pandemic a deadly blast took place in Beirut. On 4th of
                        August, 2020 at 6:08 pm a powerful explosion took place in the city. The blast which followed
                        the 
                        fire at the port of Beirut, resulted 135 deaths , more than 80 missing and a large number of
                        people
                        left homeless. The roof of the warehouse caught alight and there was a large initial explosion,
                        followed by a series of smaller blasts that some witnesses said sounded like fireworks going
                        off.
                        About 30 seconds later, there was a colossal explosion that sent a mushroom cloud into the air
                        and a
                        supersonic blastwave radiating through the city. That blastwave levelled buildings near the port
                        and
                        caused extensive damage over much of the rest of the capital, which is home to two million
                        people.
                        Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, although some of them too were devastated due to the blast.
                        The
                        warehouse was completely eradicated and an adjacent grain silo was heavily damaged. The blast
                        destroyed the immediate dockside area, creating a crater approximately 140 metres wide, which
                        flooded with seawater. Satellite images highlight complete devastation in the port area, with
                        one
                        ship apparently blown out of the water and onto the dockside. The explosion's shockwave blew out
                        windows at Beirut International Airport's passenger terminal, about 9km (5 miles) away from the
                        port. The blast was also heard as far away as Cyprus, about 200km (125 miles) across the
                        Mediterranean Sea, and seismologists at the United States Geological Survey said it was the
                        equivalent of a 3.3-magnitude earthquake. . Kilometers from the port, balconies were knocked
                        down,
                        windows shattered, streets were covered with glass and bricks and lined with wrecked cars. The
                        impact from the explosion shockwave was reportedly felt on the island of Cyprus 150 miles away
                        also
                        a civil defence official on the scene of the blast said his men had evacuated dozens to
                        hospitals
                        and that there were still bodies inside the port, many of them under debris. Scores of
                        ambulances
                        ferried the injured from the port area, where the wounded lay on the ground. The red cross has
                        made
                        an urgent call for blood donations while the head of Lebanese red cross told local TV there were
                        hundreds of casualties although many were superficial wounds from broken glass. 


                        The president Michel Aoun said that blast was caused by 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate it is
                        used
                        as fertilizer and even as an explosive. The chemical was confiscated by the government from a
                        stranded ship and was stored in the port without proper safety measures for six long years.
                        This has lead to a blame game in the country among the official and the government. The head of
                        custom authority and the head of port told that they had written the judiciary several times
                        asking
                        for the chemical to be sold to ensure the safety of the port but no action was taken for the
                        above.
                        The economic minister of the country says, “I think it is all because of the bad management.”


                        Specialist at the University of the Sheffield in the UK estimate that the blast had about one
                        tenth
                        of the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The matter has been
                        handed over to the specialists. Supreme defence council has vowed that found responsible will
                        face
                        maximum punishment. Even the netizens want a fair decision on the above.</p>

                    <p>On 4th of August, 2020 in the evening a deadly  took place which created a shock wave that
                        shattered
                        glasses for miles in Beirut the capital of Lebanon. It is said that the explosion happened
                        because
                        of ammonium nitrate kept in the port from last six years without any precautionary measures.



                        Multiple reports suggest that a huge tremor-causing explosion was preceded by a fire, possibly
                        of
                        firecrackers. Newly surfaced documents show that at least 10 times, over the past six years,
                        authorities from Lebanon's customs, military, security agencies and judiciary raised alarm that
                        a
                        massive stockpile of explosive chemicals was being kept with almost no safeguard at the port in
                        the
                        heart of Beirut. But, the government did not heed attention to these documents reported
                        earlier. 


                        Large quantities of stored ammonium nitrate are regarded as a major fire hazard, with multiple
                        reported cases across the world. Big stockpiles of ammonium nitrate can explode in two possible
                        ways. One is by some type of detonation or initiation because the storage comes in contact with
                        explosive mixture or an outside source of energy. Second, the blast can result due to a fire
                        which
                        starts into the ammonium nitrate storage because of the heat generated due to the oxidation
                        process
                        at large scale. 


                        Primary observations by the experts point serious lack of maintaining safety norms at the
                        explosive
                        storage of such chemical. There are also questions about how ammonium nitrate and another source
                        of
                        fire were present so close to each other, which caused the widespread destruction.


                        Lebanese President, Michel Aoun said "there are two possible causes of the explosion that killed
                        nearly 150 people - either negligence or 'external intervention' by a missile or bomb." Aoun
                        said
                        the Lebanese government's investigation into the cause of the explosion is concentrating on 20
                        people. Port officials have been put under house arrest. The explosion caused a deadly effect
                        resulting 135 deaths, 5,000 injuries, more than 100 not found and approx 300,000 were left
                        homeless.
                        Due to this the government has announced an emergency for the next two weeks in the country. The
                        case is under investigation as to know who triggered the explosion.</p>

                    <p>The full horror and scale of the damage caused by massive explosion in Lebanon's capital killed
                        at
                        least 100 people and injured thousands more. The blast triggered a huge mushroom cloud,
                        flattering
                        much of the city's port, damaging buildings, and littering debri's everywhere. A warehouse
                        storing
                        thousands of tons of unsecured highly volatile material has emerged as a possible source of
                        explosion. Lebanon's health minister said that hundreds of people have been reportedly missing
                        and
                        death toll will likely increase. Following the explosion in Beirut on Tuesday (4Aug) the death
                        toll
                        has risen to at least 350 and the number of injured to 5000.




                        International aid flights began to arrive, as Lebanon's leaders struggled to deal with the
                        aftermath
                        of the devastating blast, paralysed by an economic crisis and facing a public where many already
                        blame chronic mismanagement for the disaster. The residents of Beirut are stunned, sleepless and
                        stoic  as emerged from the aftermath of a catastrophic explosion searching for missing
                        relatives,
                        bandaging their wounds and retrieving the left out of their houses.


                        Lebanon's cabinet declared a two-week state of emergency in the capital city and handed control
                        of
                        security in the capital to the military. Officials said they expect the death toll to rise
                        further
                        as emergency workers dig through the wreckage to search for survivors.


                        Beirut's city governor, Marwan Abboud said up to 300,000 people have lost their homes and
                        authorities are working on providing them with food, water and shelter.


                        Prime Minister Hassan Diab, appealed to all countries and friends of Lebanon to extend help to
                        the
                        small nation, saying:  "We are witnessing a real catastrophe."  He declared a national day of
                        mourning soon after the blast occurred. He said those responsible for the "catastrophe"  would
                        be
                        held to account. President Michel Aoun called for "urgent" defence council talk in the aftermath
                        of
                        the explosion.  
                        EU Commissioner for Crisis Management said, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism is now
                        coordinating
                        the urgent deployment of over a 100 highly trained firefighters, with vehicles, dogs and
                        equipment,
                        specialised in search and rescue in urban contexts. "They will work with the Lebanese
                        authorities to
                        save lives on the ground."</p>

                    <p>Tha countdown of this explosion started years back, when a troubled russian leased cargo ship
                        made an
                        unscheduled stop at the city's port. An indebted vessel crewed by sullen transport. The chemical
                        "ammonium nitrate" was purchased by international Bank of Mozambique for making explosives it
                        was
                        being transported via leased russian ship. The people did not have money to pay for passage
                        through
                        the Suez canal. Thus, at the ship in Beirut port, after some legal procedure the vessel was kept
                        in
                        the port as they did not have money for further voyage. Later it was heard that the chemical
                        will be
                        auctioned but it never happened. All this ended on Tuesday in a giant explosion. It devastated
                        one
                        of the middle East most foundly regarded cities Beirut.


                        Ammonium nitrate  is a white crystalline solid, which is soluble in water. It consists of ions
                        of
                        ammonium and nitrate. It is made in large industrial quantities through the chemical reaction of
                        nitric oxide and ammonia. It is primarily used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertiliser, but
                        it
                        is also used to create commercial explosives for mining and construction. Ammonium nitrate is
                        made
                        all over the world and is relatively cheap to buy. But storing it can be a problem, and it has
                        been
                        associated with serious industrial accidents in the past
                        Ammonium nitrate is an industrial chemical commonly used in fertilizers and as an explosive for
                        quarrying and mining. It is an oxidizer considered relatively safe if uncontaminated. But it is
                        extremely dangerous if contaminated, mixed with fuel or stored unsafely. A large quantity of
                        ammonium nitrate exposed to intense heat can trigger an explosion. Storing the chemical near
                        large
                        fuel tanks in large quantities and in a poorly-ventilated facility can cause a massive blast.
                        'This
                        is probably up there among the biggest non-nuclear explosions of all time,' says Roland Alford,
                        managing director of a company that specializes in the disposal of explosive ordnance. 


                        A common chemical ingredient of agricultural fertilisers, the nitrogen rich compound is also the
                        main component of the explosive composition known as ANFO — ammonium nitrate fuel oil. Ammonium
                        Nitrate alone is not ANFO. ANFO is premixed Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil (Diesel, Kerosine,
                        fermented molasses,) powdered aluminum is sometimes added to the batches used for military
                        grade 
                        explosives to speed up the detonation.




                        On its own, ammonium nitrate is relatively safe to handle. However, if large amount of this
                        material
                        lying around for a long time, it will begin to decay. Over time it will absorb bit of moisture
                        and
                        eventually turn into an enormous rock. This makes it more dangerous because if  fire reaches it,
                        the
                        chemical reaction will be intense. When ammonium nitrate explodes, it can release toxic gases
                        including nitrogen oxides and ammonia gas. The nitrogen oxide, which is often associated with
                        air
                        pollution. 




                        Ammonium nitrate has been used by armies around the world as an explosive. It has also been used
                        in
                        several terrorist acts. However, for combinations to explode, triggers like detonators are
                        required.
                        Many Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) used by terrorists around the world have ANFO as the
                        main
                        explosive, triggered by primary explosives like RDX or TNT. In the majority of terror attacks in
                        India, including those in Pulwama, Varanasi, Malegaon, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai,
                        ammonium
                        nitrate has been used along with initiator explosives like RDX.</p>

                    <p>The virus was confirmed to have reached  Lebanon in February 2020. Lebanon recorded its first
                        case of
                        coronavirus on February 21 and following the entry of several new cases coming. Thus, preventive
                        measures were taken such as avoiding public venues, like resorts and theaters. Post this, the
                        closure of schools, universities, and nurseries was extended to March 14. However, numbers
                        steadily
                        increased until a national lockdown was announced on March 15, supplemented by an overnight
                        curfew
                        11 days later. As of 10 June 2020, some of the hardest-hit cities and towns in the country
                        include 
                        Beirut and its metropolitan area, Bcharre in the north of the country and  Majdel Anjar in the 
                        Beqaa Governorate. Lebanon recorded 3582 cases so far with 47 deaths and 1671 recoveries.


                        Lebanon have been badly hit  by the corona virus pandemic, then the economic crisis and now the
                        nuclear like explosion.
                        After the catastrophic explosion that shook the city of Beirut on August 4,  Lebanon now
                        recorded
                        highest 255 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day. COVID-19 testing has been halted across Beirut
                        following
                        Tuesday’s deadly explosion. The blast struck the country amid an increasingly dangerous second
                        wave
                        of the virus, and experts are worried. Russia sent 5 Emergency Situations Ministry planes to
                        Beirut
                        to assist in eliminating the consequences of the explosion. A mobile hospital with doctors and a
                        laboratory was also sent to Lebanon to detect the coronavirus. Thus, Lebanon has confirmed a
                        RECORD
                        255 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours.
                        The infection rate stands at 4,604 in the country, since the outbreak first began in February.
                        The
                        pandemic has heightened the woes of a crisis-hit country swaying from a massive explosion that
                        killed more than 130 people, wounded at least 5,000 and left an estimated 300,000 homeless. Many
                        people forgot their face masks as they packed up into vehicles, riding with strangers on the
                        move to
                        hospitals, which were also damaged by the explosion. This put a further strain on the nation's
                        health system which was already running short on personal protective equipment and struggling
                        with
                        more than 5200 cases of COVID 19. 


                        Health Minister, Hamad Hassan said "Due to the emergency and panic, I am worried that treating
                        the
                        wounded in hospitals and the loss of personal protection equipment supplies may have an impact
                        on
                        the number of coronavirus patients in the next 10 days." 


                        Lebanon's hospitals were, for the first time in months, overwhelmed with cases other than
                        COVID-19,
                        with people severly wounded post explosion. Since the explosion, people have crowded into the
                        hardest hit districts to scrutinize their damaged homes and businesses, or as volunteers in
                        cleanup
                        efforts. The blast forced authorities to suspend a lockdown that was supposed to last until
                        August
                        10.
                        It is still too soon to know what impact the explosion will have on Lebanon’s coronavirus
                        outbreak.
                        Though testing, contact tracing and the hospitalization of severely ill patients continue,
                        according
                        to the World Health Organization, health workers and aid agencies are sounding the alarm.


                        Beirut explosions stoke fears of coronavirus spike as hospitals are overwhelmed. The city is
                        decimated with thousands of residents left homeless, a medical system already strained from
                        coronavirus and up to $5 billion worth of damage.</p>

                    <p>Any country's or city's demographics play's a very important role in it's planning and
                        development.
                        It is very strange to come across the fact that the country Lebanon's capital Beirut also known
                        as
                        largest city of the country has not taken a formal census or population count since 1930's.
                        Because
                        of that the exact population count of the country varies depending on the sources.
                         No recent population census has been conducted, but 2007 estimates ranged from slightly more
                        than 1
                        million to 2.2 million as part of Greater Beirut which makes it the third largest city in the
                        Levant
                        region and the fifteenth - largestin the Arab world. 


                        Beirut's 2020 population is now estimated at 2,424,425. In 1950, the population of Beirut was
                        322,360. Beirut has grown by 195,720 since 2015, which represents a 1.70% annual change. These
                        population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World urbanisation
                        projects. These estimates represent the Urban agglomeration of Beirut, which typically includes
                        Beirut's population in addition to adjacent suburban areas. Though, recent estimates put the
                        population at around 361,000 with the broader metro area being home to over 2.2 million
                        residents.


                        On a peninsula  at the midpoint of Lebanon's Mediterranean coast, Beirut is an important
                        regional
                        seaport. It is one of the most religious and diverse cities in the Middle East. There is a total
                        of
                        18 recognized religions within the area, include four Muslim sects, twelve Christian sects, and
                        a
                        Jewish sect. The city was relatively well blended until the civil war when segregation occurred.
                        The
                        eastern side of the city is mainly Christian, while the western side has a Sunni Muslim
                        majority.
                        However, in recent years, religious groups are becoming more integrated.</p>

                    <p>The capital of Lebanon, Beirut which faced a deadly blast on Tuesday 4th August 2020 is going
                        through
                        its worst phase after the explosion that took place. The country was already suffering a major
                        economic downturn before the devastating explosion and UN agencies have warned of a humanitarian
                        crisis unless food and medical aid are delivered swiftly.
                        The Lebanese Parliament, all the Ministries and most of the public administrations, embassies
                        and
                        consulates are there.  Beirut Governorate is one of eight mohafazat.




                        Reports quickly emerged that Lebanese customs officials had requested the disposal of the highly
                        combustible materials. Public outrage erupted in Beirut, after reports emerged that the Lebanese
                        government had known about the explosive materials being stored at the port that fueled the
                        deadly
                        catastrophe, though their disposal had been requested on multiple occasions. Protestors marched
                        towards the government building shouting to change the president. As they call the blast the
                        result
                        of negligence of the government. Ater the blast France president visited the city and promised
                        to
                        help them. But he even stated that he won't give a blank check to such a government whose
                        citizens
                        doesn't have faith on them. The country was already going through economic crises due to corona
                        virus disease. Many lost jobs, undisputed deaths due to covid-19, with edible shortage for the
                        public. This was worsen by the deadly blast. Because of the early condition and addition to that
                        this blast have not even left them in a condition to rebuild their home.


                        The tragedy has triggered widespread outrage in Lebanon, where people see it symbolically, the
                        persistent government corruption and neglect, calling for the resignation of the country’s top
                        politicians. 


                        Lebanese Prime Minister, Hassan Diab and his cabinet resigned after the deadly explosion under
                        pressure from protests over long term government neglect and corruption that have sought to
                        overturn
                        the country's political elite and devastated large parts of central Beirut. Mr. Diab said,  
                        "I set out to combat corruption, but I discovered that corruption is bigger than the state, I
                        declare today the resignation of this government. God bless Lebanon." He will go to the
                        presidential
                        palace to "hand over the resignation in the name of all the ministers." Several key ministers
                        and at
                        least nine members of parliament announced their resignations. However,  the Cabinet members
                        will
                        continue to serve in a caretaker role until a new government is formed.




                        Mr. Diab's government lasted less than eight months. It was formed in January after the former
                        prime
                        minister, Saad Hariri, stepped aside in late 2019 under pressure from protests that demanded
                        political reform and an end to corruption.</p>

                    <p>The city Beirut of lebanon is going through a tough time from a long time. The country is going
                        through a economic crisis, financial crisis and government crisis. Lebanon's economy was already
                        in
                        crisis then the blast hit Beirut. Soon after the explosion, there is crisis amid food shortages,
                        economic struggle.
                        The massive explosion swayed the city Beirut with 135 people dead and 5,000 injured. However,
                        the
                        number of deaths is expected to raise. Moreover, the blast displaced 300,000 people.


                        In the past year, a breakdown in the country's banking system and inflation had triggered mass
                        protests. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the World Bank projected that 45% of people in
                        Lebanon would be below the poverty line in 2020. The situation such that middle class and poor
                        people are not able to afford important households. It can also be called as a health crisis.
                        The
                        International Monetary Fund last forecast that Lebanon's economy - beset by soaring food prices,
                        a
                        collapsing currency and Covid-19 - would contract by 12% this year. That is far worse than the
                        4.7%
                        average drop in output forecast for the Middle East and central Asia. The country defaulted on
                        some
                        of its debt in March. Lebanon had been looking to secure a $10 billion loan from the IMF, but
                        talks
                        stalled last month.


                        Few months ago as an economic crisis caused the country's capital to collapse and sore. The
                        country's pound or lira has lost about 85% of its value. It is said to be a result of government
                        corruption and financial mismanagement. This lead to unemployment and poverty. There have been
                        many
                        protests against the political elites due to the breakdown of banking system and sky rocking in
                        the
                        country. All this paused after the lockdown imposed due to COVID 19. 


                        The mass protest again gained pace after the explosion took place on 4th August,2020 in Beirut
                        port.
                        As people claim it to be a result of complete negligence and mismanagement of the government. As
                        the
                        explosion took place because of ammonium nitrate which is highly combustible, even after knowing
                        all
                        this and receiving letter regarding removing it, and essential precautionary measures to the
                        same
                        the government and ministry did nothing. This period has made rich richer, middle class a poor
                        and
                        the poors to a detitue.


                        The nation's government debt levels have for years been among the highest in the world, as were
                        current account deficits. Lebanon produces little and depends heavily on imports, including most
                        of
                        its food. It was borrowing heavily to pay for these imports. The collapse of Lebanon's financial
                        system is symptomatic of a wider failure of governance.


                        The explosion declared Beirut, a "disaster city", has piled more pressure on its economy. The
                        incident destroyed dozens of buildings. The major part of the city is swayed. The port where the
                        blast occurred is the nation's main maritime hub, and 60% of the country's imports pass through
                        it.
                        With the Lebanese currency in free fall and unemployment above 30 per cent, it is predicted more
                        than half the population will be living in poverty by the end of the year.</p>

                    <p>On  14th of February, 2005 the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri was killed when a car
                        bomb exploded as his convoy passed in a street in central Beirut.  After fifteen and a half
                        years, a
                        UN-backed tribunal has tried four members of Hezbollah in their absence, on charges of allegedly
                        planning and organising this attack. 


                        The incident took place 15years ago in Beirut one of the city of lebanon, when Rafik Hariri  was
                        executed along with 21 others. By a suicide bomber in an explosive packed van, behind which
                        Hariri
                        car was being driven. This blast devasted the capital of Lebanon roiled the middle East.
                         The case gained pace in the year 2009 and the entire trial was based of phone records. The
                        Lebanon's suspected the blast was done by Syria as they always interfere in their matter. After
                        the
                        investigation they took out warrant against four. Tribunal faces doubts as Hezbollah chief
                        Hassan
                        Nasrallah refused to hand over the defendants.


                        The four defendants were:
                        Salim Ayyash, 56, is accused of leading the team that carried out the bombing, which involved a
                        truck packed full of explosives that detonated near Hariri’s motorcade on February 14, 2005.
                        Assad Sabra, 43, and Hussein Oneissi, 46, asent a fake video to news channel claiming
                        responsibility
                        on behalf of a made-up group.
                        Hassan Habib Merhi, 54, is accused of general involvement in the plot.
                        The alleged mastermind of the bombing, Hezbollah commander Mustafa Badreddine, is believed to
                        have
                        died while fighting with the Syrian government in May 2016. And many more alligations were
                        imposed
                        upon them. They will be punished with a sentence of life imprisonment if convicted. 


                        The current prime minister said that the circumstances brought about by the pandemic,  Lebanon
                        should avoid riots triggered by the court's verdict. "Confronting the conflicts is a priority." 
                         Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Assad Hassan Sabra and Hussein Hassan Oneissi are
                        accused
                        of allegedly conspiring to commit the terrorist attack that killed Hariri and 21 others. 


                        Although the verdict was scheduled to be announced in May, it had to be delayed because of the
                        COVID-19 pandemic. The attack was claimed by a previously unknown fundamentalist group called
                        Victory of the Jihad in Greater Syria. However, the accusation believes that it could be a false
                        claim, so they initiated the corresponding proceedings. This 'in absentia' trial is the first
                        such
                        trial since the Nuremberg trials after World War II.</p>

                    <p>Beirut the capital and the largest city in Lebanon has its own uniqueness and importance. The
                        city is
                        also known as Paris of middle East as percolotes the same old city captivating french. The
                        reason
                        behind this resemblance is that, lebanon was under French control from 1920 to 1943.


                        In the words of the famous poet Mahmoud Darwish, "A city that cannot be known by its smell is
                        unreliable..... A smell is a memory and a setting sun." 
                        The tangy smell of a manoushe, where zaatar and zeit collide to create the most fragrant of
                        smells,
                        always remind one of Beirut. Despite being one of the smallest countries in the middle east and
                        all
                        of Aisa. Lebanon debatably has the most diverse culture. Its multi-religious, multi-ethnic and
                        multi- lingual.


                        All the places to visit in Beirut city share history and character with some of the most exotic

                        Beirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the Mediterranean Sea. It is flanked by the
                        Lebanon Mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation
                        between
                        and two hills. The coast is diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside
                        one

                        inhabited city which makes a whole lot of history. This can even be seen as many nondescript
                        mid-century residence and houses make its architectural pearls stand out even more in context.
                        It is
                        also known for its historical  buildings and archeology. The wide avenues and boulevards built
                        by
                        French colonial rulers match the glorious mosque complexes that were built by the Ottomans and
                        the
                        Mamluks, and the ancient ruins of Roman temples and bathhouse top it all.
